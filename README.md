## Machine learning guided optimal composition selection of niobium alloys for high temperature applications

## Design Strategy
First, we created a high dimensional input feature space for each alloy composition based on the domain knowledge-based material descriptors. Then, a machine learning model was trained to predict the targeted property by learning the alloysâ€™ feature-property relationship. A virtual quaternary and quinary alloy compositions space has been created and using the trained machine learning model with bootstrapping technique we estimated the uncertainties for each candidate in virtual space. Thereafter, the Bayesian optimization algorithm was applied which evaluated a utility function based on the uncertainties of prediction for each candidate to suggest suitable alloy composition.
